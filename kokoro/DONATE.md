# Donate

Apache software is free software.

For those able & willing to support my work, I accept *unconditional, no-strings-attached* donations in the form of **GPU cloud credit** (and soon, via GitHub Sponsors). This helps me run experiments and train models.

Please do not "attach strings" to donations since I cannot serve them through donation channels (that includes model requests, consulting, brand sponsorships).

Also, along the lines of "Never buy a product based on the future promise of updates", I would discourage you from donating because you expect a specific model to come down the pipeline. Hopefully, donors broadly believe that good things happen when [someone gets this man (yours truly) a GPU](https://i.redd.it/r8dtt3n9rc431.jpg).

### Vast.ai Referral Link
Vast.ai is a vendor I use for cloud GPUs. I "earn 3% of all referred customer revenue as credits": [https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=79907](https://cloud.vast.ai/?ref_id=79907)

### Vast.ai Transfer Credit
To transfer $5 of credit directly to my Vast.ai account `hello@hexgrad.com`, you can use `transfer credit` in the Vast CLI like so:

```sh
vastai transfer credit hello@hexgrad.com 5
```

The usage of the `transfer credit` command is documented here: https://docs.vast.ai/api/commands#voyTE

```sh
usage: vastai transfer credit RECIPIENT AMOUNT

positional arguments:
  recipient          email of recipient account
  amount             $dollars of credit to transfer

Transfer (amount) credits to account with email (recipient).
```

### RunPod Referral Link
RunPod is another vendor I use for cloud GPUs. I earn "5% from serverless and 1% from templates": https://runpod.io?ref=pup8o2ly

### RunPod Credit Codes
After signing in to RunPod, under `Account > Billing > Credit Codes`, you can "generate a code that allows you to gift funds to another RunPod user":

> Simply give them the code and they will be able to redeem it for credits on their billing page. Please safeguard your codes as they are worth money!
> Credits will be debited from your account immediately. You can redeem the code yourself if you want to recover your credits. There is a 2% transaction fee for payment processing!

If you wish to send codes, you can do so by emailing `hello@hexgrad.com`, or DM me on Discord `@rzvzn`.

### Coming Soon: GitHub Sponsors
